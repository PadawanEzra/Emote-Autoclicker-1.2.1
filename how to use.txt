[How to use!]
Hold F1 and it will spam click b and click.






Plans for update:


[Make the gui easier on the eyes]
(I like the design of my gui, but I feel like the color scheme is a little off and a lil hard on the eyes.)

[user can customize the gui]
(I want it so tht the user can customize how the gui looks by themselves with ease without havin to change the code directly)

[have it so they can set their own keybinds for macro]
(pretty self explanatory, user can change it so that the macro does a different button than what is prechosen, and can change the hotkey.)
